# An Interpretable Short-term Rainfall Forecasting Method Based On Attention Mechanism
Abstract: In order to improve the accuracy of short-term rainfall forecast in meteorological operations, an interpretable short-term rainfall forecasting method based on attention mechanism is proposed. The factors were normalized after calculating SPI index. Then, the meteorological factors closely related to rainfall were screened out by random forest algorithm. Long-short term memory network integrating multi-head attention was constructed as the rainfall prediction model, it could solve the information loss of rainfall series and strengthen the ability to extract important information. In addition, attention weight was visualized to enhance interpretability of the model. Experiments at 92 stations in China show that the method has generalization ability. The results show that the method is better than the existing methods in the prediction of short-term heavy rainfall.
